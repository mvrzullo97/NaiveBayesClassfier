# NaiveBayesClassfier
The package naive_bayes provides an efficient implementation of the popular Naive Bayes classifier in R. In this project I implemented two different 
versions; Multivariate Naive Bayes and Multinomial Naive Bayes with a novel feature selection criteria based on Kullback-Leibler divergence (logarithm 
of the conditional probabilities).
